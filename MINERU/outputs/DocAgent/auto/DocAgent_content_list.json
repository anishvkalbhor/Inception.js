However, generating it automatically using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, as existing approaches often produce incomplete, unhelpful, or factually incorrect outputs. We introduce DocAgent, a novel multi-agent collaborative system using topological code processing for incremental context building. Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation. We also propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Comprehensive experiments show DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines consistently. Our ablation study confirms the vital role of the topological processing order. DocAgent offers a robust approach for reliable code documentation generation in complex and proprietary repositories. Our code1 and video2 are publicly available. ",

        "text": "We addressed the challenge of automatically generating high-quality code documentation, a task where existing LLM-based methods often struggle with incompleteness, lack of helpfulness, and factual inaccuracies. We introduced DocAgent, a novel tool-integrated, multi-agent system that leverages a dependency-aware topological processing order determined by a Navigator module. This allows specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) to collaboratively generate documentation by incrementally building context from dependencies. We also proposed a robust and scalable evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Our experiments on diverse Python repositories demonstrate that DocAgent significantly outperforms FIM and Chat baselines consistently, producing more complete, helpful, and factually accurate documentation. An ablation study confirmed the critical contribution of the topological processing order to both helpfulness and truthfulness. DocAgent represents a promising step towards reliable and useful automated code documentation generation for complex and proprietary software. ",

Applying DocAgent to proprietary code necessitates careful handling, especially regarding external queries, to avoid inadvertently leaking sensitive information. Finally, the computational resources required for LLM-driven multi-agent systems represent a notable cost and environmental consideration. Future work should address these limitations, focusing on robustness, bias mitigation, and deeper evaluation, while emphasizing that human oversight remains crucial in practical deployment. ",

Multi-agent systems (CAMEL (Li et al., 2023b), AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023)) extend these ideas with role-specialized LLMs and structured communication to handle more complex problems. In software development, MapCoder (Zhang et al., 2023b), RGD (Chen et al., 2023), and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023) leverage specialized agents for many downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art code generation.

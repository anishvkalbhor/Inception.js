The National Education Policy lays particular emphasis on the development of the creative potential of each individual. It is based on the principle that education must develop not only cognitive capacities - the ‘foundational capacities’ of literacy & numeracy and ‘higher-order’ cognitive capacities, such as critical thinking and problem solving but also social, ethical, and emotional capacities and dispositions. Built on the foundational pillars of Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability and Accountability, the policy aims to transform India into a vibrant knowledge society and global knowledge superpower by making both school and college education more holistic, flexible and multidisciplinary.

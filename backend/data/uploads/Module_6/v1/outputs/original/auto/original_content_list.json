The main function of smooth pursuit is to reduce motion blur on the retina; this is also known as image stabilization.

Hold your finger at a comfortable distance in front of your face and fixate on it. Next, yaw your head back and forth (like you are nodding “no”), turning about 20 or 30 degrees to the left and right sides each time. You may notice that your eyes are effortlessly rotating to counteract the rotation of your head so that your finger remains in view. The eye motion is involuntary. If you do not believe it, then try to avoid rotating your eyes while paying attention to your finger and rotating your head. It is called a reflex because the motion control bypasses higher brain functions. Based on angular accelerations sensed by vestibular organs, signals are sent to the eye muscles to provide the appropriate counter motion. The main purpose of the VOR is to provide image stabilization, as in the case of smooth pursuit. ",

Because head motion has six DOFs, it is appropriate to break the gain into six components. In the case of head pitch and yaw, the VOR gain is close to 1.0. For example, if you yaw your head to the left at $1 0 ~ \\textdegree$ per second, then your eyes yaw at $1 0 \\textdegree$ per second in the opposite direction. The VOR roll gain is very small because the eyes have a tiny roll range. The VOR translational gain depends on the distance to the features.The VOR comfortably adapts to this problem by changing the gain. Now suppose that you are wearing a VR headset that may suffer from flaws such as an imperfect optical sys- tem, tracking latency, and incorrectly rendered objects on the screen. In this case, adaptation may occur as the brain attempts to adapt its perception of stationarity to compensate for the flaws. In this case, your visual system could convince your brain that the headset is functioning correctly, and then your perception of stationarity in the real world would become distorted until you readapt. For example, after a flawed VR experience, you might yaw your head in the real world and have the sensation that truly stationary objects are sliding back and forth!2 ",

This implies that the pixels are updated line by line This procedure is an artifact of old TV sets and monitors, which each had a cathode ray tube (CRT) with phosphor elements on the screen. An electron beam was bent by electromagnets so that it would repeatedly strike and refresh the glowing phosphors. Due to the slow charge and response time of photoreceptors, we do not perceive the scanout pattern during normal use.

This is due tomany factors already mentioned, such as optical distortions, tracking latency, and display scanout. Thus, the retinal image slip due to VR artifacts does not match the retinal image slip encountered in the real world.

In this ca the eyes strongly converge, but they do not need to change the optical power of the eye lens. T eyes may nevertheless try to accommodate, which would have the effect of blurring the perceiv image. The result is called vergence-accommodation mismatch because the stimulus provided by VR is inconsistent with the real world. Even if the eyes become accustomed to the mismatch, the user may feel extra strain or fatigue after prolonged use. The eyes are essentially being trained to allow a new degree of freedom: Separating vergence from accommodation, rather than coupling them. New display technologies may provide some relief from this problem, but they are currently too costly and imprecise. For example, the mismatch can be greatly reduced by using eye tracking to estimate the amount of vergence and then altering the power of the optical system. ",

The main goal of visual neuroscience is to understand how neural activity results in visual perception, as well as behaviors dependent on vision. In the past, visual neuroscience has focused primarily on how the brain (and in particular the Visual Cortex) responds to light rays projected from static images and onto the retina. While this provides a reasonable explanation for the visual perception of a static image, it does not provide an accurate explanation for how we perceive the world as it really is, an ever-changing, and ever-moving 3-D environment. The topics summarized below are representative of this area, but far from exhaustive. To be less topic specific, one can see this textbook for the computational link between neural activities and visual perception and behavior: \"Understanding vision: theory, models, and data\" , published by Oxford University Press 2014.

For example, a camouflaged animal in the forest might only become noticeable when moving. This is clearly useful whether humans are the hunter or the hunted. Motion also helps people to assess the 3D structure of an object. Imagine assessing the value of a piece of fruit in the market by rotating it around. Another use is to visually guide actions, such as walking down the street or hammering a nail. VR systems have the tall order of replicating these uses in a virtual world in spite of limited technology. Just as important as the perception of motion is the perception of nonmotion, which we called perception of stationarity Stroboscopic apparent motion Nearly everyone on Earth has seen a motion picture, whether through a TV, smartphone, or movie screen. The motions we see are an illusion because a sequence of still pictures is being flashed onto the screen. This phenomenon is called stroboscopic apparent motion; it was discovered and refined across the 19th century . The zoetrope, shown in Figure 6.15 was developed around 1834. It consists of a rotating drum with slits that allow each frame to be visible for an instant while the drum rotates. ",

It is easy to distinguish individual frames, but the motion a person would also be perceived. Once 10 FPS is reached, the motion is obviously more smooth and we start to lose the ability to distinguish individual frames. Early silent films ranged from 16 to 24 FPS. The frame rates were often fluctuating and were played at a faster speed than they were filmed. Once sound was added to film, incorrect speeds and fluctuations in the speed were no longer tolerated because both sound and video needed to be synchronized. This motivated playback at the fixed rate of 24 FPS, which is still used today by the movie industry. Personal video cameras remained at 16 or 18 FPS into the 1970s. The famous Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination in 1963 was taken at 18.3 FPS. Although 24 FPS may be enough to perceive motions smoothly, a large part of cinematography is devoted to ensuring that motions are not so fast that jumps are visible due to the low frame rate. Video see-through displays are one of the most popular and widely used display technologies when it comes to virtual reality. It generally takes video images from one or two cameras and superimposes it with digitally generated imagery. The combined image then becomes the display that the user views. ",

Instead, an active approach can be taken by transmitting waves into the environment. Since humans operate in the same environment, waves that are perceptible, such as light and sound, are not preferred. Instead, common energy sources in active tracking systems include infrared, ultrasound, and electromagnetic fields. Consider transmitting an ultrasound pulse (above 20, $0 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z } )$ from a speaker and using a microphone to listen for its arrival. This is an example of an emitterdetector pair: The speaker is the emitter, and the microphone is the detector. If time measurement is synchronized between source and destination, then the time of arrival (TOA or time of flight) can be calculated. This is the time that it took for the pulse to travel the distance d between the emitter and detector. Based on the known propagation speed in the medium $3 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ for ultrasound), the distance $\\mathrm { \\hat { \\Omega } d }$ is stimated. One frustrating limitation of ultrasound systems is reverberation between surfaces, ausing the pulse to be received multiple times at each detector. ",

If all features appear to be the same, then it may become difficult to determine and maintain “which is which” during the tracking process.

For artificial features, one of the simplest solutions is to print a special tag onto the object to be tracked. For example, one could print bright red dots onto the object and then scan for their appearance as red blobs in the image. To solve the distinguishability problem, multiple colors, such as red, green, blue, and yellow dots, might be needed. Trouble may occur if these colors exist naturally in other parts of the image. A more reliable method is to design a specific tag that is clearly distinct from the rest of the image. Such tags can be coded to contain large amounts of information, including a unique identification number. One of the most common coded tags is the QR code. ",
